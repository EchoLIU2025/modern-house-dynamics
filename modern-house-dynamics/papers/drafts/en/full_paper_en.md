# English: Modern House Dynamics: Cadent Powers the Path, Succedent Mediates, Angular Consolidates

# Chapter 1  Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Problem Definition

In mainstream narratives of Western astrology, the houses often form a stable rule of thumb based on **positional power**: **angular** > **succedent** > **cadent**. In pre-modern societies characterized by ascriptive identity and stable structures, this static ranking was highly isomorphic to social reality: angular houses aggregated visibility and public office/title; succedent houses carried the accumulation and continuation of resources; cadent houses were regarded as marginal, preparatory, or transitional domains of activity.
However, in today’s high-mobility and **platformed** lifeworld, the above static strong–weak scheme is insufficient to explain individual developmental pathways. Most lives do not open with a pre-given identity and status, but begin from cyclical practices of learning and expression, daily routines and service, the formation of worldview, and integration and giving-back—**practices that belong precisely to the cadent domain**. Without a mediating mechanism that can transcribe such inner outputs into socially exchangeable and scalable forms, one’s path struggles to reach the stable and visible outcomes associated with the angular houses.

## 1.2 Research Aim and Thesis Statement

This paper proposes and argues for a **house-level** pathway framework whose core thesis is:
**Cadent → Succedent → Angular** is the more explanatory functional sequence under modern conditions. Cadent provides a cyclical starting point of **capacity and meaning**; succedent, as a **mediating layer**, converts cadent outputs into socially up-taken **artifacts/resources/relations**; angular completes **presentation and consolidation**.
The key axiom is the **Axiom of Mediation**: cadent outputs do not lead directly to angular; they must be mediated by succedent. At the same time we establish **succedent as an open set**: in modern society, multiple media and channels coexist; cadent may connect to any succedent, and no fixed route is prescribed.

## 1.3 Analytical Level and Methodological Stance

* **Level delimitation:** The entire paper discusses structure and semantics strictly at the **house level**; execution-level factors such as planetary dignities, aspect networks, or benefic/malefic judgments are not introduced, in order to keep the framework **tool-agnostic**.
* **Methodological stance:** A **semiotic/archetypal** mode of interpretation is adopted, attending to meaning and function rather than causal prediction; the emphasis is on the dynamic structure constituted by **pathway** and **mediation**.
* **Compatibility:** The framework maintains **isomorphic translatability** across house systems and schools, aiming to serve as a stackable **meta-model**.

## 1.4 Preview of Core Concepts

To avoid terminological ambiguity, four nodal concepts are defined in advance:

1. **Cadent** — **initiation & cycle**: the domain of capacity and meaning related to learning/practice/up-leveling/integration.
2. **Succedent** — **mediation & transduction**: the layer that transcribes cadent inner outputs into artifacts/resources/relations that society can uptake.
3. **Angular** — **presentation & consolidation**: the layer that fixes already mediated artifacts as identity/foundations/contracts/status.
4. **Artifact** — any form that can be socially recognized, exchanged, accumulated, and scaled; including but not limited to: works/texts, methods/workflows, services/reputation, capital/contracts, communities/networks, data/models, institutions/credentials, etc. The list is non-exhaustive; their shared property is **social uptake**.

## 1.5 Theoretical Motivation and Necessity

* **Explanatory gain:** Rewriting “strong–weak judgment” as a dynamic structure of **pathway–mediation–consolidation** explains why many contemporary individuals begin with cadent practices but achieve stable angular presentation only when an effective succedent mediation is formed.
* **Paradigm clarification:** **Angular strength ≠ reachability of angular**; the “result strength” of angular and the “ability to reach that result” are logically distinct, the latter depending primarily on cadent activation and whether mediation holds.
* **Media neutrality:** In a platformed society, succedent forms are highly diverse; defining succedent as an **open set** avoids route clauses that lead to over-fitting and enhances cross-context usability.
* **Cross-school reading:** As an upper-level framework, this model can converse in parallel with psychological astrology, narrative pedagogy, and sociological analysis without presupposing specific techniques.

## 1.6 Claims of Contribution

(1) Proposes a functional sequence centered on **Cadent → Succedent → Angular**, replacing static strength hierarchies;
(2) Establishes the Axiom of Mediation and the **open set** nature of succedent, arguing that cadent may connect to any succedent without fixed routes;
(3) Distinguishes **result strength** from **starting momentum**, clarifying that angular consolidation depends on cadent activation plus succedent mediation;
(4) Builds a cyclical perspective: a **growth loop** (cadent → succedent → angular → 1′ → cadent) and an **attenuation loop** (cadent degradation → succedent idling → unstable/angular shell → weak restart), laying the structural groundwork for the chapters that follow.

## 1.7 Roadmap

* **Chapter 2** defines terminology and levels (house level ≠ planetary level) and presents the main diagram.
* **Chapter 3** systematically proposes the theoretical framework and axioms: functional triad, directionality, mediation, succedent as open set, stratification, lamination/cycle, and corollaries.
* **Chapter 4** contrasts the traditional “angular supremacy” view with the present model in terms of context and explanatory aim (without tracing fixed routes).
* **Chapter 5** develops the bifurcation of loops (growth/attenuation) and explains the pivotal status of the mediating layer.
* **Chapter 6** positions the framework as a house-level interpretation for **modern personality restructuring**.
* **Chapter 7** offers discussable propositions and potential avenues of falsification (conceptual level).
* **Chapter 8** states fit and boundary conditions.
* **Chapter 9** concludes and outlines follow-up research (execution level and data-informed studies as separate continuations).

# Chapter 2  Definitions of Concepts and Terms (House-Level)

This chapter establishes the conceptual framework and lexical boundaries on which the whole paper relies. Unless otherwise specified, the following discussion proceeds only at the **house level**; it does not introduce execution-level factors such as planetary dignities, aspect networks, or benefic/malefic evaluations; and it remains **tool-agnostic** with respect to house systems and technical routes.

## 2.1 Level of Analysis and Scope (Scope)

● **House level:** discusses structure and semantics—the functional roles and interrelations of the various houses within the pathway.
● **Execution level (not treated in this chapter):** planets/aspects/house rulers/dignities, used to describe operational strength and concrete mechanisms.
● **Applicability:** the framework maintains **isomorphic translatability** across different house systems such as Placidus, Whole Sign, and Porphyry; it is compatible with psychological astrology, classical techniques, and narrative pedagogy.

## 2.2 Partition & Notation

Let the set of the twelve houses be ( H = {1, \dots, 12} ), partitioned into three subsets:
● **Cadent set ( C = {3,6,9,12} ):** initiation & cycle.
● **Succedent set ( S = {2,5,8,11} ):** mediation & transduction.
● **Angular set ( A = {1,4,7,10} ):** presentation & consolidation.
Terminological mapping: **Cadent（果宫）**, **Succedent（续宫）**, **Angular（角宫）**.

## 2.3 Functional Roles

● **Cadent｜果宫:** provides the cyclical kinetic energy and meaning framework for learning, practice, worldview formation, and integration; constitutes the starting and cycling positions of the pathway.
● **Succedent｜续宫:** functions as the mediating layer, transcribing cadent inner outputs into artifacts/resources/relations that can be socially received and scaled; constitutes the transduction position of the pathway.
● **Angular｜角宫:** fixes already mediated artifacts as identities, foundations, contracts, and status recognizable both internally and externally; constitutes the result position of the pathway.

## 2.4 Working Definition of “Artifact”

To avoid route prescriptions and media bias, this paper defines **artifact** as:
**any form that can be socially recognized, exchanged, accumulated, and scaled.**
Non-exhaustive examples: works/texts (book, paper, media); methods/workflows (method, SOP); services/reputation (service, reputation); capital/contracts (capital, contract); communities/platforms (community, platform); data/models (dataset, model); institutions/credentials (institution, credential), etc.
The common feature is **social uptake**, rather than the “legitimacy” of any particular channel.

## 2.5 Mediation & Connectivity

Core claim: cadent outputs do not lead directly to angular; they must be mediated by succedent.
● **Directionality (functional order):** **Cadent → Succedent → Angular**.
● **Open connectivity:** cadent may connect to **any** succedent; many-to-many承接与汇聚 are allowed (the same cadent output may be concurrently received by multiple succedent forms, or different cadent outputs may converge within the same succedent form).
● **No fixed routes:** the model is media/platform-neutral and does not prescribe a “correct gate.”
Intuitive expression: **“First become an artifact; then become a structure.”** If mediation is absent or fails, stable consolidation at the angular level is unattainable.

## 2.6 Stratification

● **Result strength ≠ reachability:** the “stability/visibility” presented at angular does not entail “automatic attainment.” Whether the result position can be reached depends on whether cadent is activated and whether succedent mediation is effective.
● Accordingly, we must logically distinguish **Angular strength** (result strength) from **Path reachability** (reachability of the pathway).

## 2.7 Glossary

● **capacity / meaning（能力/意义）:** the inner kinetic energy and frameworks in the cadent domain related to learning, practice, worldview, and integration.
● **mediation / transduction（中介/转译）:** the process that converts inner outputs into socially receivable “artifacts.”
● **artifact（产物）:** a socially recognizable, exchangeable, accumulable, and scalable form (open set).
● **consolidation（定格）:** the process of fixing artifacts as identity and structure; the functional focus of angular.
● **tool-agnostic（工具中立）:** not presupposing effectiveness preferences for specific techniques or media.
● **isomorphic translatability（等距可译）:** maintaining structural correspondence and readability across different house systems and schools.

# Chapter 3  Framework & Axioms

This chapter presents and argues for the core structure of the paper. At the **house level**, we take the triad “cadent–succedent–angular” as the skeleton, state six core axioms plus one connectivity axiom, and derive three immediate corollaries. Throughout the chapter, we do **not** introduce execution-level factors such as planetary dignities, aspect networks, or benefic/malefic judgments; the framework remains **tool-agnostic** with respect to house systems and technical routes.

## 3.1 Axiom 1: Functional Triad

**Proposition:** Functionally, the twelve houses can be divided into three domains:
● **Cadent:** initiation & cycle, providing the capacity/meaning for learning, practice, worldview formation, and integration.
● **Succedent:** mediation & transduction, transcribing cadent inner outputs into artifacts/resources/relations that society can uptake.
● **Angular:** presentation & consolidation, fixing already mediated artifacts as identity, foundations, contracts, and status.
**Elaboration:** This tripartition concerns semantics and function rather than moralized comparisons of “strength.” Its validity derives from delineating the pathway by which, in modern society, **capacity becomes structure**.

## 3.2 Axiom 2: Functional Order

**Proposition:** Functionally there is a stable ordering tendency:
**Cadent → Succedent → Angular.**
That is, capacity/meaning (cadent) is transcribed via mediation (succedent) into artifacts, which can then achieve **presentation and consolidation at the result position (angular)**.
**Elaboration:** Directionality states a functional sequence; it does not presuppose linear duration and does not claim one-way causality. The aim is to distinguish the three stages—**activation, transduction, consolidation**—and to avoid mistaking “the stability of results” for “the inevitability of starting conditions.”

## 3.3 Axiom 3: Mediation Requirement

**Proposition:** Cadent outputs do not lead directly to angular; they must be mediated by succedent.
**Intuitive phrasing:** **First become an artifact, then become a structure.**
**Elaboration:** In modern society, any form that can be socially received and scaled (works, methods, services, capital, communities, data, institutions, etc.) requires the mediating layer to complete the transcription into what is **recognizable—exchangeable—accumulable—scalable**. If mediation is absent or fails, stable consolidation at the angular level is unlikely.

## 3.4 Axiom 4: Succedent as an Open Set

**Proposition:** Succedent is an **open set**; the model prescribes no “fixed channel or medium.” The **artifact** lineage can expand with context and era, including but not limited to: works/texts, methods/workflows, services/reputation, capital/contracts, communities/platforms, data/models, institutions/credentials, etc.
**Elaboration:** This axiom guarantees media neutrality and cross-context adaptability, preventing historically common routes from being mistakenly elevated into a principled “only path.”

## 3.5 Axiom 5: Stratification Independence

**Proposition:** The “result strength” of angular does **not** entail “automatic attainment of that result.”

1. Whether consolidation at angular can be reached depends on two things: **cadent activation** (whether effective capacity/meaning outputs are formed);
2. Whether **succedent mediation** is effective (whether those outputs are transcribed into artifacts society can uptake).
   **Elaboration:** Accordingly, we must logically distinguish **Angular strength** (result strength) from **Path reachability** (conditions for reaching the result position). The former describes the stability of consolidation; the latter describes the conditions for arriving there.

## 3.6 Axiom 6: Lamination & Cycle

**Proposition:** When angular achieves a relatively stable consolidation, it can be regarded as entering the next starting point (denoted **1′**), and returning to the cadent cycle (under a new identity re-engaging learning/practice/up-leveling/integration).
**Elaboration:** Development appears as multi-round **identity lamination** and cyclical regeneration rather than a single endpoint; each round’s “angular consolidation” becomes the starting condition for the next round’s “cadent activation.”

## 3.7 Axiom of Cadent-to-Succedent Connectivity

**Proposition:** Cadent may connect to **any** succedent, allowing many-to-many **uptake and convergence**.
The same cadent inner output can be received in parallel by multiple succedent forms; outputs from different cadent domains can also **converge** within the same succedent form.
**Elaboration:** This axiom removes any “fixed route.” The criterion for connection is **not** whether some prescribed path was followed, but whether **effective mediation** has occurred (i.e., whether recognizable, exchangeable, accumulable, scalable **artifacts** have formed).

## 3.8 Corollaries

**Corollary 1: Necessity of Mediation**
If succedent mediation is absent or fails, consolidation at angular is unattainable; even if **episodic visibility** appears, stable structure is difficult to maintain.

**Corollary 2: Non-isomorphic Consolidations**
Different artifact lineages (e.g., works-led, capital-led, community-led, institution-led, data-led, etc.) lead to **non-isomorphic** angular presentations: modes of visibility, durability, and forms of social embedding differ structurally.

**Corollary 3: Bifurcation of Loops**
When cadent is activated and succedent mediation is effective, a **growth loop** forms (cadent → succedent → angular → 1′ → cadent); otherwise, a **negative/attenuation loop** emerges (cadent degradation → succedent idling/under-uptake → unstable/angular shell → weak restart). The watershed between the two loops lies in whether **mediation** is established.

## 3.9 Chapter Summary

With six axioms and one connectivity axiom, this chapter establishes the upper-level backbone of a modern house-pathway model:
● The functional triad clarifies the role division of **activation—mediation—consolidation**;
● Directionality provides the sequence **cadent → succedent → angular**;
● The mediation requirement together with succedent-as-open-set ensures tool neutrality and contextual fit;
● Stratification distinguishes **result strength** from **path reachability**;
● Lamination/cycle reveals the structural dynamics of multi-round development;
● Connectivity guarantees the open-uptake principle that **cadent may connect to any succedent**.

# Chapter 4  Classical Contrast

This chapter, along the two dimensions of **paradigm** and **context**, reads against each other the traditional view of **angular supremacy** and this paper’s view of **angular-as-result**; it argues that the two are not mutually exclusive but correspond to different social ontologies and explanatory aims. The entire chapter remains strictly confined to the **house level**; it does not involve planets, aspects, or case techniques; it sets **no fixed routes through the succedent houses**.

## 4.1 Paradigm Contrast: Strength Hierarchy vs Pathway–Mediation–Consolidation

● **Classical paradigm (static ranking):** based on positional power, it forms a static strong–weak experience of angular > succedent > cadent; the explanatory focus is on **visibility** and **stability**.
● **The present paradigm (pathway model):** it depicts the developmental process by functional sequence: cadent (capacity/meaning) → succedent (mediation/transduction) → angular (presentation/consolidation); the explanatory focus is on **how capacity becomes structure**.
**Key point:** the classical paradigm answers *“where is strong,”* whereas the present paradigm answers *“how to reach.”*

## 4.2 Social-Context Difference: Ascription vs Achievement

● **Pre-modern context (ascription):** identity was largely pre-given by family, estate, guild, or office, and social channels were narrow; the angular houses naturally aggregated “skeletal identity and public office/title,” so “angular supremacy” had high explanatory power for that lifeworld.
● **Modern context (achievement / platformed):** expansion of education, division of labor, and platformed uptake mean that individuals often start from learning–practice–worldview–integration (the cadent domain); whether one is socially received and scaled depends on whether the succedent mediating layer forms exchangeable, accumulable artifacts; angular houses appear more as the **result position**.
**Conclusion:** “angular supremacy” is an apt static description for ascriptive societies; in achievement-first societies, a dynamic pathway model is required.

## 4.3 Shift of Explanatory Aim: From “Strength Judgment” to “Reachability Analysis”

● **Classical aim:** to gauge whether a place is strong, visible, and stable; hence angular houses are placed at the evaluative center.
● **Present aim:** to analyze **how** stability is reached, emphasizing the functional sequence cadent → succedent → angular and the necessity of mediation.
**Distinction:**
● **Angular strength (result strength):** the stability of consolidation and public visibility after fixation.
● **Path reachability:** whether the conditions to move from cadent to angular are in place (cadent activation, succedent mediation).
In modern contexts, **strong angular ≠ automatic reachability of angular**; reachability depends on **cadent activation + succedent mediation**.

## 4.4 Re-glossing the Three Domains: “Same Terms, Different Meanings” Across Two Contexts

● **Angular**
○ **Classical context:** the original site of skeletal identity and visible order (office/title/estate).
○ **Modern context:** the endpoint of consolidation/presentation; its stability derives from whether the prior chain of **artifact → uptake → scaling** has been established.
● **Succedent**
○ **Classical context:** the continuation and inheritance of resources, often tied to property, succession, and maintenance.
○ **Modern context:** the mediating/transductive layer that rewrites capacity/meaning into artifacts/resources/relations; its forms constitute an **open set** (works, methods, services, capital, communities, data, institutions, etc.).
● **Cadent**
○ **Classical context:** a marginal/preparatory/transitional domain of activity.
○ **Modern context:** the domain of initiation and cycle (learning, practice, worldview, integration), providing transferable capacity and frames of meaning—the source of activation for the pathway.
**Summary:** the same terminology undertakes different explanatory functions under different social ontologies; the usage adopted here is a functional, pathway-based semantics closer to the modern experiential world.

## 4.5 Principles of Compatibility: How to “Include the Classical Without Negating It”

● **Context containment:** when identity and uptake mechanisms are **pre-installed** in society, the classical “angular supremacy” approximates a configuration in which mediation at the succedent layer has already been completed—angular visibility and stability can then be “given.”
● **Path priority:** when individuals advance primarily through capacity → artifact → uptake, the present cadent → succedent → angular model better explains **how attainment occurs**.
● **Bridge statement:** classical “angular supremacy” is the boundary case in which the mediating layer is institutionalized and embedded within identity structures; the present model provides general reachability conditions when mediation is not pre-installed.

## 4.6 The Contribution of “Succedent as Open” to Explanatory Power

● **Media neutrality:** the succedent does not prescribe channels or platforms, avoiding the mistake of treating historically common routes as the sole legitimate path.
● **Portability:** when new uptake mechanisms appear (e.g., digital platforms, open-source ecosystems, data and models as assets), the model requires no rewrite—one simply regards them as new artifact lineages.
● **Falsifiability:** evaluation centers on **whether mediation has been completed** (i.e., whether socially receivable artifacts have formed), rather than on enumerating routes; thus space for refutation is preserved (if large samples show “stable consolidation without mediation,” the model must be revised).

## 4.7 Counterfactual Reflection: What Is Missed if “Angular as Starting Point” Is Retained?

● **Missing the activation stage:** it overlooks the production and cycling of capacity and meaning in the cadent domain, conflating “result strength” with “starting momentum.”
● **Missing the mediation bottleneck:** it cannot explain why substantial capacity and effort fail to convert into a stable, visible social position.
● **Missing diversified uptake:** under new media and platform environments (communities, data, institutions), the fixed-route assumption becomes distorted.

## 4.8 Chapter Conclusion

Classical “angular supremacy” has high adequacy within ascriptive social contexts; in achievement-first, platform-uptake modern contexts, the explanatory focus must shift from **strength hierarchies** to **pathway–mediation–consolidation**. Therefore, this paper maintains:
● **Angular = result position;** its stability derives from the prior establishment of **cadent (capacity/meaning)** and **succedent (mediation/artifacts)**;
● **Cadent = initiation/cycle;** it provides the activation source of transferable capacity and meaning;
● **Succedent = open mediating layer;** it undertakes the necessary step of **“first become an artifact, then become a structure”**;
● **Cadent may connect to any succedent;** no fixed routes are set, and many-to-many uptake and convergence are permitted.
This definitional shift grants the model greater explanatory power, fit, and falsifiability in the modern experiential world. The next chapter (Chapter 5) accordingly develops a structured account of positive and negative loops, showing how the mediating layer becomes the watershed between the two circuits.

# Chapter 5  Loops: Growth & Attenuation

This chapter constructs two parallel circuits and explains why the succedent (the mediating layer) constitutes the watershed. The entire chapter adheres to a **house-level** account: it does not enter planetary factors or case techniques; it prescribes no fixed routes.

## 5.1 Definitions & Schema

● **Growth loop**
Cadent (activation) → Succedent (mediation/scaling) → Angular (consolidation) → 1′ (new starting point) → Cadent
**Cadent (activation) → Succedent (mediation/scaling) → Angular (consolidation) → 1′ (new starting point) → Cadent**
**Meaning:** capacity/meaning is activated in the cadent domain, transduced via the succedent into artifacts that can be received; a stable presentation is formed at the angular houses, which in turn triggers the next round of identity and capacity up-leveling.

● **Attenuation loop**
Cadent (degradation) → Succedent (idling/under-uptake) → Angular (hard to consolidate/short-lived shell) → weak start → Cadent
**Cadent (degradation) → Succedent (idling/under-uptake) → Angular (hard to consolidate/short-lived shell) → weak start → Cadent**
**Meaning:** activation in the cadent domain is insufficient or disordered; the succedent fails to form exchangeable/accumulable artifacts; failed mediation leads to unstable presentation at the angular level or merely a “shell,” returning to a weaker starting point.

**Main-diagram reminder:** Cadent (capacity/meaning) → Succedent (artifacts/resources/relations; open set) → Angular (identity/structure).
**Slogan-like phrasing:** “First become an artifact; then become a structure.”

## 5.2 Dynamics of the Growth Loop (Cadent → Succedent → Angular → 1′)

1. **Cadent (activation):**
   Learning and expression (3), daily routine and practice (6), worldview and law/principle (9), integration and giving-back (12) constitute the minimal closed loop of capacity/meaning. The outputs here are still internalized or semi-visible.
2. **Succedent (mediation/scaling):**
   Cadent outputs are transcribed into artifacts/resources/relations—works, methods, services, capital, communities, data, institutions, credentials, etc. (open set). This step makes them recognizable, exchangeable, accumulable, and scalable, thereby obtaining social uptake.
3. **Angular (consolidation):**
   Uptaken and scaled artifacts are fixed at the result positions 1/4/7/10 as identity and structure; visibility and stability rise, forming a phase “zenith.”
4. **1′ (new starting point):**
   Each consolidation triggers the next round: with a new identity, one returns to the cadent domain to unfold a higher-order cycle of learning–practice–up-leveling–integration; development appears as lamination and regeneration.

## 5.3 Mechanism of the Attenuation Loop (Attenuation via Failed Mediation)

1. **Cadent (degradation/disorder):**
2. **The cycle of capacity/meaning is not sufficiently established or keeps dissipating:** imbalance between input and expression (3), loosened action and routine (6), fractures in worldview (9), insufficient integration or withdrawal without uptake (12). **Succedent (idling/under-uptake):**
   Fails to generate artifacts that can be socially recognized and exchanged; or the artifacts are not accumulable and not scalable (e.g., only fragmentary outputs, no institutional uptake, no network support).
3. **Angular (hard to consolidate/short-lived shell):**
   The presentation layer struggles to form stable structure; even if there is episodic “visibility,” it lacks sustainable fixation and structural embedding, easily reverting to a “shell.”
4. **Weak start:**
   Return to a starting point of lower energy, making the next round of cadent activation more difficult and entering an inertia of descending energy levels.

## 5.4 Why the Succedent Is the Watershed (Mediation as the Watershed)

● **Functional reason:** the succedent transcribes **inner outputs** into **social artifacts**—the crucial conversion **from “capacity” to “thing,” from “meaning” to “handle.”**
● **Structural reason:** social **uptake** occurs in the succedent—without uptake, there is no scaling and embedding; without embedding, angular presentation cannot be sustained.
● **Model inference:** the same cadent kinetic potential bifurcates into ascending or attenuating circuits depending on whether succedent mediation is sufficient or lacking.

## 5.5 Conceptual Prompts (Non-operational Indicators)

To preserve house-level purity, this book sets no quantitative thresholds or case indicators; it provides structured questions to help discern the direction of the loop:
● **First question: What are the outputs of cadent?**
Do you see learning/expression (3), action/routine (6), worldview/terminology system (9), or integration/giving-back (12)?
—Confirm whether capacity/meaning has formed describable inner成果.
● **Second question: Have they been transduced via the succedent into “artifacts”?**
Have these inner成果 been uptaken by any succedent form as works/methods/services/capital/communities/data/institutions/credentials, etc.?
—Examine whether mediation holds: recognizable, exchangeable, accumulable, scalable.
● **Third (derived) question: Is the angular presentation stable?**
If the answer bifurcates according to “yes/no” in the first two questions, assign to the growth/attenuation loop accordingly.
These three are conceptual **reading prompts**, not diagnostic tools; they aim to move attention from “static strength” to “pathway and mediation.”

## 5.6 Boundaries & Edge Cases

● **No route prescription:** the succedent is an open set; there is no sequence of “must first arrive somewhere”; any form that completes mediation is acceptable.
● **Episodic visibility ≠ stable consolidation:** short-term exposure or labels do not equal structural embedding at the angular level; return to the second question to verify sufficiency of mediation.
● **Loops are not fate:** growth/attenuation can be rewritten at the succedent layer (e.g., completing uptake, changing the artifact lineage), thereby altering subsequent angular presentation and the energy level of the next starting point.

## 5.7 Summary

Using **cadent → succedent → angular** as the axis, we delineate two parallel circuits:
● **Growth loop:** cadent (activation) → succedent (mediation/scaling) → angular (consolidation) → 1′ (re-enter cadent) — energy ascends;
● **Attenuation loop:** cadent (degradation) → succedent (idling/under-uptake) → angular (hard to consolidate/short-lived shell) → weak start — energy descends.
The key determinant is whether mediation at the succedent layer is established. Therefore, first ask **“What are the outputs of cadent?”** then ask **“Have they been transduced via the succedent into artifacts?”**—these two questions are the structured starting point for identifying the loop’s direction. The next chapter (Chapter 6) will, on this basis, position the house-level pathway for **modern personality restructuring**: re-order capacity and meaning from cadent, mediate them through succedent into artifacts, and ultimately consolidate as identity and structure at angular.

# Chapter 6  Positioning the Pathway for Modern Personality Restructuring (House Level Only)

This chapter positions the previously outlined **cadent–succedent–angular** pathway as a house-level perspective for **personality restructuring** in the modern context. As used in this paper, “personality” refers strictly to **structural disposition** and **path position** in the semantics of houses, not to psychological diagnosis or clinical concepts; it does not involve execution-level factors such as planetary dignities, aspect networks, or benefic/malefic judgments. The aim is to offer a **meta-level, tool-agnostic** unified vantage point for chart reading and teaching across different schools.

## 6.1 Framing (Scope)

● **Object:** the individual’s developmental path and self-presentation in modern society—how “capacity/meaning” becomes “identity/structure.”
● **Level:** discuss only the division of roles and functional sequence at the house level; execution level (planets/aspects) will be treated in subsequent papers.
● **Method:** take **pathway** and **mediation** as the core categories, avoiding the mistake of reading static “strength/weakness” as dynamic “reachability.”

## 6.2 Three Propositions (P1–P3)

### Proposition P1 | **Cadent Priority**

**Statement:** personality **restructuring** should be initiated in the cadent domain; that is, from the four quadrants of learning/expression (3), daily routine/practice (6), worldview/law (9), and integration/giving-back (12), establishing a transferable cycle of capacity and meaning.

**Argument Points**

1. **Source of activation:** in modern contexts, individuals typically begin with inner production in education, skills, method, values, and integration—all of which fall within cadent semantics.
2. **Cyclicality:** the cadent is not “leftover” space but a repeatable closed loop of capacity/meaning; its outputs are the precondition for any social uptake.
3. **Entry for change:** when the goal is “restructuring,” prioritizing adjustments in the cadent domain—learning modes, practice rhythms, worldview frames, and integration mechanisms—has greater plasticity and replicability than directly pursuing “visible results.”

**Reading/Teaching Prompts (conceptual level)**
● First identify: what is this person’s current **cadent output**? (knowledge frame? practice workflow? terminology system? integration pathway?)
● Then assess: has this output formed a **minimal closed loop** (learn → practice → frame → integrate)? Where is the gap?

### Proposition P2 | **Succedent Mediation**

**Statement:** before stable presentation is reached, one must **“first become an artifact, then become a structure.”** The succedent is the mediating/transductive layer that rewrites cadent inner outputs into socially recognizable, exchangeable, accumulable, and scalable artifacts/resources/relations. The succedent is defined as an **open set**: no fixed channels or media are presupposed.

**Argument Points**

1. **Watershed:** whether an uptake-ready “artifact” can form determines whether the path enters an ascending loop or an attenuating loop (see Chapter 5).
2. **Media-neutrality:** works, methods, services, capital, communities, data, institutions, credentials, etc., can all serve as mediating forms; the model’s validity does not depend on a single “correct route.”
3. **Reachability logic:** **angular strength ≠ automatic reachability of angular**; reachability depends on **cadent activation + succedent mediation**, not on the a priori strength of the result position.

**Reading/Teaching Prompts (conceptual level)**
● **Q1:** Which **cadent outputs** have already been transduced into artifacts that are recognizable/exchangeable/accumulable/scalable?
● **Q2:** What mediating forms are currently in use (works, methods, services, capital, communities, data, institutions…)? Are additions or substitutions needed?
● **Q3:** Has mediation **closed the loop** (e.g., from work to uptake platform, from reputation to contract/institution), so as to avoid “output without uptake” idling?

### Proposition P3 | **Angular as Consolidation**

**Statement:** the angular presents **consolidation**, not a **starting position**. Only after artifacts have been uptaken and scaled do identity, foundation, contract, and status become structurally stable and visible at 1/4/7/10.

**Argument Points**

1. **Result position:** the angular’s “stability/visibility” describes **result strength** and does not guarantee that the result is attainable.
2. **Laminated cycles:** each stable consolidation triggers a new **1′** starting point, returning the individual to the cadent domain to initiate a higher-order cycle; life thereby becomes an accumulation of multiple identity layers rather than a one-time endpoint.
3. **Demystification:** recasting the angular from a “natural advantage” into the **fixed form of mediated artifacts** explains why similar “angular strength” can show different degrees of stability and persistence across individuals (see Chapter 3, Corollary Two: non-isomorphic consolidations).

**Reading/Teaching Prompts (conceptual level)**
● If angular-level visibility has already appeared, inquire into the **artifact chain** behind it; visibility **without** a mediation chain is usually unstable.
● If consolidation has not yet appeared, first trace back to cadent and succedent: add activation, add mediation—rather than directly pursuing “angular strength.”

## 6.3 House-level Workflow

With P1–P3 as the spine, the house-level pathway for “modern personality restructuring” can be summarized as a three-step workflow (conceptual guidance):

1. **Re-prime Cadent**
   a. Clarify this cycle’s **capacity/meaning goals**: what to learn, what to do, how to up-level, how to integrate;
   b. Use the “minimal closed loop” to audit rhythm and method: **learn → practice → frame → integrate**.

2. **Mediate via Succedent**
   a. Transcribe cadent outputs into artifacts/resources/relations;
   b. Select or combine suitable mediating forms (works/methods/services/capital/communities/data/institutions…);
   c. Focus on **uptake and scaling**, not output alone (avoid idling).

3. **Consolidate at Angular**
   a. From uptaken artifacts, form identity/structure at **1/4/7/10**;
   b. After consolidation, identify **1′**: return with the new identity to the cadent domain and enter the next capacity/meaning cycle.

The above are house-level process statements for thinking and teaching, not technical prescriptions; execution-level interventions (planets/aspects) should be developed separately **beneath** this process.

## 6.4 Boundaries & Fit

● **Non-diagnostic, non-prescriptive:** the “personality” concept here emphasizes structure and pathway, not psychological diagnosis; any clinical conclusions lie outside this framework.
● **Compatible across house systems and schools:** the model focuses on semantic roles and functional sequence, maintaining isomorphic translatability across house systems and technique lineages.
● **Media and platform neutrality:** the succedent is an open set that adapts to emerging uptake mechanisms (e.g., digital platforms, open-source ecosystems, data and models as assets, innovations in institutions and credentials).

## 6.5 Take-home

● **P1 Cadent Priority:** initiate structural reordering from the cadent domain, establishing and maintaining the minimal loop of capacity/meaning.
● **P2 Succedent Mediation:** use artifact-formation as the criterion; examine and optimize mediating forms and uptake chains—**“first become an artifact, then become a structure.”**
● **P3 Angular as Result Position:** regard angular “stability/visibility” as the fixation of mediated artifacts; consolidation triggers **1′** and the next cycle.

With these three propositions as a **house-level** unified perspective, different schools can, without altering their own techniques, gain a clear, compatible, and reproducible pathway backbone for reading and teaching. The next chapter will further propose discussable propositions and potential avenues of falsification, to preserve the model’s openness and scholarly tension.

# Chapter 7  Discussible Propositions and Potential Falsification (Conceptual Level)

This chapter proposes a set of propositions oriented to comparative reading and rebuttal, and offers conceptual-level criteria for “how the model could be overturned.” The entire chapter maintains a **house-level** perspective: no quantitative thresholds, and no entry into planets/aspects/case techniques. The aim is to provide a public context that is discussible, testable, and revisable across different schools.

## 7.1 Method & Level (Method & Level)

● **Method stance:** with **pathway—mediation—consolidation** as the core categories, present falsifiable statements at the level of **meaning and function**; encourage cross-school, cross-material comparative reading (texts, biographies, school curricula).
● **Level statement:** all propositions pertain only to **house-level** structure; if observations require introducing execution-level factors (planets, aspects, etc.), they should be treated as **exogenous variables** without altering the house-level proposition text.

## 7.2 Operationalizing Key Terms (without Quantification)

● **Cadent activation:** in the cadent domain (3/6/9/12), discernible inner outputs and signs of cycling (the minimal loop of learning/practice/framing/integration) are present, rather than fragmentation or stasis.
● **Succedent mediation sufficiency:** there exist artifacts and their uptake chains that are recognizable, exchangeable, accumulable, and scalable (not limited to works, methods, services, capital, communities, data, institutions, credentials, etc.).
● **Angular consolidation event:** a stable presentation at 1/4/7/10 of identity/structure (visibility and persistence), rather than a brief exposure or mere shell.
The above are **conceptual** definitions intended to secure consistency in comparative reading; no quantitative thresholds are provided.

## 7.3 Proposition D1｜Cadent Activation + Sufficient Succedent Mediation ⇒ Greater Likelihood of Stable Angular Consolidation

**Statement:** in comparative materials, if an individual/case shows cadent activation **and** sufficient succedent mediation, stable angular consolidation events are more likely to appear; conversely, if the two do not hold, angular consolidation is notably scarce or unstable.

**Envisioned comparative-reading paths (examples)**
● **Longitudinal reading:** track, within the same subject, the narrative of text/output → uptake → identity evolution, and observe whether **“cadent → succedent → angular → 1′”** closes multiple times.
● **Lateral reading:** within similar fields/periods, compare two groups—those with “sufficient succedent mediation” and those with “insufficient mediation”—and examine whether the persistence/structuralization of angular consolidation is systematically differentiated.

**Potential counterexamples (how to falsify)**
● A large body of materials shows that **in the absence of succedent mediation**, long-term stable angular consolidations still commonly appear, and **the explanation of “pre-installed mediation”** (see §7.6) can be ruled out.
● This would require revising the **Mediation Axiom** or restricting its scope of applicability.

## 7.4 Proposition D2｜Differences in Succedent “Artifact Repertoires” ⇒ **Non-isomorphic** Angular Presentations

**Statement:** different succedent artifact repertoires (work-led/method-led/service-led/capital-led/community-led/data-led/institution-led/credential-led …) correspond to **non-isomorphic** forms of angular presentation: modes of visibility, persistence, and degrees of organizational embedding differ in structure, rather than varying along a single “strong/weak” axis.

**Envisioned comparative-reading paths (examples)**
● **Typological comparison:** take “artifact repertoire” as the horizontal axis and “angular presentation form” as the vertical axis; under comparable “angular strength” narratives, contrast **work-led** vs **institution-led** consolidations and observe differences in social embedding.
● **Cross-context reading:** within the same person, check whether shifts across stages (e.g., work → institution, or community → capital) are accompanied by **reshaping** of angular presentation.

**Potential counterexamples (how to falsify)**
● If empirical comparative reading shows that **regardless of** artifact repertoire, angular presentation is always **isomorphic**, and the above differences can be fully explained by factors unrelated to the house level, then the claim of “non-isomorphic presentation” should be weakened or withdrawn.

## 7.5 Proposition D3｜If “Stable Consolidation without Mediation” is Generally Observed, the Model Requires Revision

**Statement:** if, over long-term, cross-material observation, it is found that **in the absence of mediation** or under **clearly insufficient mediation**, stable angular consolidation is **still generally achieved**, then the model’s mediation necessity requires revision (narrow its applicability or restate the conditions).

**Envisioned comparative-reading paths (examples)**
● **Historical/institutional contexts:** examine arenas with **pre-installed uptake mechanisms** (e.g., strong hereditary systems, formalized bureaucracies) to determine whether stable consolidation without **personal** succedent mediation occurs; if widespread, designate these as **boundary contexts**.
● **Counterfactual design:** compare materials under similar angular visibility, one group with a clear succedent mediation chain and another with none at all; if differences vanish and this can be repeatedly observed, it constitutes strong counterevidence.

## 7.6 Rival Explanations & Confounds

To avoid circular reasoning that “any result counts as effective mediation,” pre-identify common confounds:

1. **Pre-installed mediation:** institutions or families externalize succedent functions into social structure, making individuals **appear** to consolidate without mediation. This should be separately modeled as a boundary condition, not treated as a universal counterexample.
2. **Exogenous shock:** short-term hotspots or contingent events generate **angular visibility**, but without an uptake chain they lack persistence; do not misjudge such cases as stable consolidation.
3. **Proxy drift:** substituting **fame/exposure** for **structural consolidation** yields false positives. Return to the house-level definition of **sustainable embedding** to discriminate.

## 7.7 Conceptual Research Designs

Although no quantification is set, conceptual research frames can be proposed for subsequent implementation by different schools with their own methods:
● **A. Typological comparison:** use “artifact repertoire” as the x-axis and “angular presentation form” as the y-axis to build a contrast matrix and test whether non-isomorphism holds.
● **B. Longitudinal narratives:** track whether the **“cadent → succedent → angular → 1′”** loop repeatedly closes within the same subject, and how closure cycles and uptake chains change.
● **C. Cross-context reading:** compare the boundaries and exceptions of mediation necessity between contexts with **pre-installed mediation** and those dominated by **individual mediation**.
● **D. Null-case reading:** select cases with **high cadent activation** but **low uptake**, and examine whether they reliably enter the **attenuation loop** (angular hard to consolidate/short-lived shell).

## 7.8 Adjudication Rules: When to Acknowledge, When to Revise

● **Signs of support:** across most materials, there is a consistent structural correspondence between **cadent activation + sufficient succedent mediation** and **stable angular consolidation**; different artifact repertoires correspond to **different** angular presentation forms.
● **Triggers for revision:** if **broad, replicable counterexamples** (see D3) appear and cannot be explained by **pre-installed mediation** or **proxy drift**, the universality of the propositions should be reduced, or the statement of mediation necessity restated as a **high-probability condition**.
● **Reserved space:** allow different schools to layer their own mechanism accounts at the execution level, but without altering the meaning and logical boundaries of the propositions at this level.

## 7.9 Practice & Communication

● **Ethical reminder:** the propositions in this chapter are for theory and teaching; they should **not** be translated into value judgments or prescriptive advice for individuals.
● **Communication strategy:** in cross-school collaboration and teaching, prioritize the structured prompts **“first ask what the cadent outputs are; then ask whether they have been mediated via the succedent into artifacts”** to maintain reproducibility and minimize misunderstanding.

## 7.10 Summary

We propose three conceptual, rebuttal-oriented propositions:
● **D1:** **Cadent activation + sufficient succedent mediation ⇒** greater likelihood of **stable angular consolidation**;
● **D2:** **Differences in succedent artifact repertoires ⇒** **non-isomorphic** angular presentations;
● **D3:** if it is observed that **“stable consolidation is generally achieved without mediation,”** the model requires **revision**.

Through rival explanations and adjudication rules, this chapter provides a falsifiable entry point for the **cadent—succedent—angular** framework, maintaining the purity and cross-school readability of the house level while preserving room for future refinement at the execution and data layers. The next chapter will discuss **fit and boundaries**, ensuring robust application of the framework across house systems and teaching contexts.

# Chapter 8  Fit & Boundaries

This chapter explains the model’s fitness and application boundaries. Core stance: **house-system agnostic**, **tool-agnostic**, and **media-neutral**; capable of semantic, parallel reading with psychological astrology, narratology, and sociology. At the same time, it is clarified that this framework holds only at the **house level**; it is non-predictive, non-prescriptive, and does not introduce planets or case-level material. If, in the future, execution-level layers (planetary dignity, aspect networks, etc.) are added, they should be treated as extensions in subsequent papers and do not affect the independent standing of this framework.

## 8.1 Principles of Fit

● **House-system agnostic:** whether Whole Sign, Placidus, Porphyry, etc., this model only requires that the structural correspondence of the threefold roles be identifiable; different coordinate cuts do not change the functional semantics of “cadent—succedent—angular.”
● **Tool-agnostic:** no technique (traditional/modern, psychological/symbolic, electional/popular) is pre-assumed or preferred; as long as one can describe activation—mediation—consolidation, it can be embedded.
● **Media neutrality:** the succedent is an **open set**; works, methods, services, capital, communities, data, institutions, credentials, etc., can all serve as mediation forms; updates in technology and platforms do not require revising the model.

## 8.2 Cross-field Isomorphy

● **Psychological astrology:** the cadent cycle (learning/practice/level-raising/integration) can be read in parallel with psychological processes such as competence building, self-efficacy, and meaning integration; but this model does **not** make psychological diagnoses.
● **Narrative & pedagogy:** courses and texts can be organized by “pathway—mediation—consolidation”; this is **not** equivalent to case verification—this paper provides a theoretical spine, not a “story template.”
● **Sociology:** succedent “uptake/amplification” can be read in parallel with social capital, institutional embedding, and platform effects; but it does not replace sociological causal analysis.
The above readings are **isomorphic** in semantics, not cross-disciplinary proof.

## 8.3 Use Boundaries

● **Non-predictive:** the framework is for structural understanding and pathway discrimination; it does not commit to timing or event prediction.
● **Non-prescriptive:** it does not provide “what to do” prescriptions; “start in the cadent—mediate via the succedent—consolidate at the angular” is a way of thinking, not an intervention plan.
● **Non-case-level:** it does not enter planetary placements, aspect networks, or benefic/malefic judgments of an individual chart; case-level work should be conducted separately by each school with its own techniques.
● **Non-clinical:** “personality” here denotes only structural dispositions in house semantics; any clinical judgments are outside this framework.

## 8.4 Potential Extensions

● **Execution-level add-ons:** planetary dignity, house rulers, aspect topographies, etc., may serve as explanatory tools for **mediation preferences/weights** without rewriting house-level propositions.
● **Data-informed reading:** if conducting text measurement, biographical comparative reading, or analyses linking platform data, maintain variable stratification: house level (structural semantics) vs. execution level (mechanism of operation) listed separately to avoid level confusion.
● **Context modules:** arenas with **pre-installed mediation** (heredity/bureaucracy/institutional uptake) can be modeled separately as boundary contexts, and should not be treated as universal counterexamples to the Mediation Axiom.

## 8.5 Robustness & Portability

● **Cross-context robustness:** wherever a society has channels **from internal outputs to social uptake to identity consolidation**, this model can be applied; when channel forms change (e.g., the rise of digital platforms), simply include them in the succedent artifact repertoire.
● **Forward compatibility:** if future “artifact” categories are added (e.g., algorithmic reputation, on-chain credentials), there is no need to alter the axioms—only update the instance set of the succedent open set.
● **Pedagogical portability:** across languages and cultures, keep the core sentence **“first become an artifact; then become a structure”** and the main diagram consistent to maximize readability and generality.

## 8.6 Misuse Safeguards

● **Avoid reversion to strength ranking:** do not regress this model into the static hierarchy “angular > succedent > cadent”; it describes **pathways**, not moral grading.
● **Avoid routinization:** the succedent is an open set; common paths (e.g., “work → platform”) should not be mistaken for the only legitimate route.
● **Avoid substituting visibility for understanding:** short-term exposure ≠ angular-level consolidation; return to whether sustainable embedded artifacts and uptake chains are formed.
● **Avoid level confusion:** when layering execution-level material, strictly uphold the bottom line that **house-level propositions are not rewritten**.

## 8.7 Minimal Communicative Unit

In cross-school collaboration or teaching, it is recommended to standardize on three minimal sentences:

1. **First ask the cadent:** what are the inner outputs of this cycle (learning/practice/worldview/integration)?
2. **Then ask the succedent:** have these outputs been translated into uptake-ready artifacts (works/methods/services/capital/communities/data/institutions/credentials)?
3. **Finally look to the angular:** has stable consolidation formed, and if so, has **1′** been triggered to enter the next cycle?

## 8.8 Summary

● This model possesses house-system agnosticism, tool-agnostic neutrality, and media neutrality, and can be read in semantic parallel with psychological astrology, narratology, and sociology.
● Boundary conditions must be strictly observed: non-predictive, non-prescriptive, non-case-level, non-clinical; execution-level extensions and data-informed studies should appear as subsequent papers without altering house-level propositions.
● Through constraints on robustness, portability, and misuse prevention, the model can be applied robustly across diverse teaching and research contexts. 

# Chapter 9  Conclusion (From Strength to Pathway)

## 9.1 Reassembling the Whole: from “strength” to “pathway—mediation—consolidation”

This paper, taking the **house-level** as the sole level of discussion, completes a paradigm shift: it translates the traditional strength judgment *(angular > succedent > cadent)* into a dynamic structure of **pathway—mediation—consolidation**. The core logic is simple and stable: the **cadent** houses provide the activation and circulation of capacity and meaning; the **succedent** houses undertake mediation and transduction, turning inner outputs into artifacts/resources/relations that can be socially taken up and amplified; the **angular** houses complete presentation and consolidation, fixing the foregoing artifacts as identity/structure. This shift avoids technique-level disputes (house systems, dignities, aspects, etc.) while markedly enhancing explanatory power and pedagogical clarity for the modern lifeworld.

## 9.2 Take-home (Three Sentences)

● **Cadent powers the path** — *cadent activation*: learning/practice/up-leveling/integration constitute a reusable capacity–meaning cycle.
● **Succedent mediates** — *succedent mediation*: first become an artifact, then become a structure; the succedent houses form an open set with no fixed routes.
● **Angular consolidates** — *angular consolidation*: presentation and fixing occur at the result position; angular strength ≠ automatic reachability; reachability depends on “cadent activation + succedent mediation.”

## 9.3 Implications

1. **Teaching and communication:** replace fuzzy strength comparisons with the three-step phrasing “first ask cadent, then ask succedent, finally look at angular,” thereby significantly lowering cross-tradition communication costs.
2. **Chart-reading orientation:** shift attention from “the visibility of the result” to “the artifact chain and uptake chain,” which better explains why similar angular visibility can differ in stability.
3. **Contextual fit:** defining succedent mediation as a media-neutral open set allows smooth adaptation to new uptake mechanisms (platforms, data, institutions, etc.) without structural rewrites of the model.

## 9.4 Outlook I: Execution-level Add-ons

Without rewriting house-level propositions, future standalone papers may treat planets/aspects/rulers and dignities as explanatory variables of **mediation preferences and weights**:
● **As weightings,** to explain why the same cadent output is more readily taken up by certain succedent forms (e.g., work-artifact–led, institution-led, capital-led, community-led, data-led).
● **As dampers/amplifiers,** to explain efficiency differences in mediation steps and differences in the durability of angular consolidation.
This preserves the structural backbone at the house level and lets the execution level operate beneath it in a stratified manner, avoiding level confusion.

## 9.5 Outlook II: Data-informed Reading

Without sacrificing house-level purity, one may undertake data-informed comparisons:
● **Typological matrix:** construct a cross-tab of “artifact lineages × angular presentation forms” to test the robustness of non-isomorphic consolidations (echoing D2 in Chapter 7).
● **Longitudinal closure observation:** track repeated closures and cycle changes of “cadent → succedent → angular → 1′” within the same subject to verify lamination/cycle mechanisms.
● **Boundary-context modeling:** treat institutional contexts of “pre-installed mediation” as a separate module to verify the applicability domain of mediation necessity (echoing the falsification threshold in D3).
Data-informed work is **not** identical with causal claims; its task is to provide empirical support and counterexamples for the house-level structure.

## 9.6 Boundaries

This paper does not engage in prediction, does not prescribe, and does not enter casework or clinical domains; “personality” refers only to structural dispositions in house semantics. Any execution-level or practical operations must be layered beneath this framework without altering the **cadent—succedent—angular** propositions.

## 9.7 Closure

Replacing a “strength hierarchy” with “pathway—mediation—consolidation” gives us an explanatory backbone closer to the modern experiential world, without triggering technique debates. In brief: **cadent ignites, succedent shifts gears, angular lands.** So long as we uphold “first become an artifact, then become a structure,” and maintain clear stratification between house level and execution level, this model can operate robustly and keep evolving across traditions, house systems, and media environments.

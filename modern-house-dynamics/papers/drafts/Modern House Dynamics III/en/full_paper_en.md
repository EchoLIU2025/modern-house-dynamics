# Modern House Dynamics in Relationships: The Temporal–Structural Mechanism of Cadent Activation, Succedent Mediation, and Angular Fixation in Intimacy

# Chapter 1 · Introduction: Problem and Positioning

In modern psychological and social astrology, “intimate relationships” are often treated as the product of inborn structure. Traditional frameworks focus on the strength of the **angular houses (1/4/7/10)**, planetary placements, and aspect configurations to explain tendencies in dating, marriage, and family. However, this static orientation faces two long-standing difficulties:

* **Insufficient structural explanatory power:** many charts possess favorable relationship configurations (e.g., a strong 7th house, a well-aspected Venus), yet in lived reality remain in a prolonged state of “relationship not yet fixed.”
* **Absence of a temporal dimension:** while transits, progressions, and life stages are acknowledged as triggers, there is a lack of a structural model that can systematically explain **why** relationships advance or stall.

In other words, traditional astrology can indicate “relational potential,” yet struggles to explain “relational process.” The **Cadent–Succedent–Angular Pathway** proposed here aims to supply both a logical and a temporal complement to that gap.

The basic proposition of this study is:

**Romance and marriage are not determined by the “inherent strength” of the angular houses, but are driven by a three-stage pathway of cadent activation, succedent mediation, and angular fixation.**

Within this model:

* The **cadent houses (3/6/9/12)** represent learning, communication, value-alignment, and unconscious interaction in relationship;
* The **succedent houses (2/5/8/11)** represent the **“mediating artifacts”** and **“chains of conveyance”** of the relationship;
* The **angular houses (1/4/7/10)** represent formalized structural relationship: identity, family, marriage, and social recognition.

If marriage is taken as an end state, the cadents correspond to the emergence and learning stage of romance; the succedents translate emotion into socially recognizable **relational artifacts** (such as children, assets, contracts, or communal acknowledgment); and the angulars are the fixation of the relationship within social structure (such as marriage, family, a shared home, or public status).

The **Axiom of Mediation (Relationship Edition)** proposed here states:

**Without succedent mediation, angular fixation is unattainable.** That is, if a relationship lacks artifacts that can be socially conveyed and received, then even with strong angular configurations, it is difficult to form a long-term stable structure.

This proposition applies within astrological consultation and also possesses cross-disciplinary explanatory force: it reveals the structural gap between psychological intimacy and social embedding—relationship success depends not only on psychological fit (cadents) but, more critically, on the existence of a sustainable mediating bridge (succedents) leading toward stability and embedding at the social level (angulars).

The scope of this paper is limited to the **house level**; it does not involve benefic/malefic evaluations, aspect details, or predictive prescriptions. Methodologically, it follows the same principles as the earlier work: **tool-agnostic**, **open set**, and **falsifiability**. The goal is to establish a structural model usable for empirical work and teaching, so that “the evolution of relationship” can receive temporal and pathway-based explanation within an astrological framework.

# Chapter 2 · Terminology and Sets: The Relational Domain

This chapter establishes the basic structural sets of the “romance–family” domain, using the three functional layers of **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** as the framework and restricting the discussion to the house level. The aim is to transform relationship development from “static configuration” into “structural pathway,” thereby providing a model that is analyzable, verifiable, and teachable.

## 2.1 The Threefold Set: Structural Levels of Relationship

In the relational domain, the three house classes undertake different functional dimensions:

* **Cadent (C = {3, 6, 9, 12})** signifies the stage of **learning–adaptation–understanding–integration** in relationship. It includes communication (3), cooperation and daily life (6), values and beliefs (9), and unconscious patterns and attachment (12). → Corresponds to the **activation layer** of relationship: encounter, adaptation, understanding, empathy.

* **Succedent (S = {2, 5, 8, 11})** signifies the stage of **artifact-making and conveyance**, i.e., how a relationship is translated into a socially recognizable form. It includes value resources (2), emotional creations and children (5), sharing and contracts (8), and community and networks (11). → Corresponds to the **mediation layer**: artifacts, bridges, institutional conveyance.

* **Angular (A = {1, 4, 7, 10})** signifies the stage of **fixation and embedding**, i.e., the final integration between the individual and social structure. It includes identity and self (1), family foundations (4), marital contracts (7), and social recognition and role (10). → Corresponds to the **presentation layer**: identity establishment, family fixation, social embedding.

**Proposition P-1 (Structural Correspondence):**
Cadents undertake the **activation of relational learning**; succedents undertake the **socialization and artifact-making of emotion**; angulars undertake **recognition and fixation**. Together they constitute the complete pathway of relationship evolution.

## 2.2 A Working Definition of the “Relational Artifact”

In the emotional domain, a “relational artifact” refers to any relational form that can be **recognized, exchanged, accumulated, or scaled** by society. It is not limited to marriage in the legal sense; rather, it is a form of structural visibility. The four succedent houses typically correspond as follows:

| Succedent | Type of Artifact                                              | Examples                                                         | Function                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **5th**   | Emotional creation, children, mementos, co-creation           | Childbearing, artistic collaboration, rites                      | Forms a **co-generated entity**, triggering a tendency toward familization     |
| **8th**   | Joint assets, debts, contracts, deep psycho-sexual commitment | Joint loans, cohabitation agreements, sexual–psychological union | Forms a **sharing mechanism**, triggering unity of rights and responsibilities |
| **11th**  | Communal recognition, friend-network, wedding/announcement    | Wedding, public posting to social circles, shared vision plans   | Forms **external stability**, gaining social echo                              |
| **2nd**   | Resource and personal value made exchangeable                 | Bride price/dowry, budget division, skills as assets             | Forms a **quantifiable trust structure**                                       |

The forms of these artifacts vary with culture, life stage, and individual differences, yet their core logic is the same: for emotion to stabilize, it must land through a **chain of mediation** that society can receive.

## 2.3 The Open Set of Succedents

The succedents do not presuppose a single pathway; they constitute an **open set**. Anything meeting the following conditions can be considered effective mediation:

* **Recognizable**
* **Exchangeable**
* **Accumulable**
* **Scalable**

If a relational artifact satisfies **two** of the above, it enters the stage of “mediation effective”; if it satisfies **three or more**, it forms a **closed chain of conveyance**, possessing the potential for angular fixation.

Therefore:

* different cultural backgrounds (e.g., Western wedding institutions, Eastern family recognition);
* different relationship stages (e.g., dating, cohabitation, parenting, co-building a venture);
* even non-traditional forms (e.g., transnational partners, open relationships, collaborator-based families)

can all find their place within the succedents’ open set. The key is not formal legality but whether the form can **stably convey cadent outputs** and **support angular fixation**.

**Proposition P-2 (Definition of Mediation):**
In the relational domain, any form that can be socially recognized and can **sustainably convey cadent outputs** may be regarded as “succedent mediation.” **Without such mediation, angular fixation is not sustainable.**

---

# Chapter 3 · Axioms and Theorems: Reframing in the Relational Domain

Building on the three-layer structure of *Modern House Dynamics*, this chapter reformulates its application to the **relationship domain**, presenting six core axioms and three derived theorems.
The purpose of this framework is to shift the understanding of romance and marriage from **configuration-based interpretation** to **path-based structure**, thereby granting them temporality, phase progression, and verifiability.

---

## 3.1 Axiom of Functional Division

The formation and fixation of relationships follow a three-stage functional structure:

**Cadent (Activation) → Succedent (Mediation) → Angular (Fixation)**

| Level         | Houses      | Keywords                                                    | Function                                          |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cadent**    | 3, 6, 9, 12 | Learning, communication, adaptation, integration            | Activation and inner construction of relationship |
| **Succedent** | 2, 5, 8, 11 | Production, conveyance, institutionalization, socialization | Mediation and socialization of emotion            |
| **Angular**   | 1, 4, 7, 10 | Identity, foundation, contract, social role                 | Fixation and embedding of relationship            |

**Proposition A-1:**
A relationship does not form instantaneously; it evolves sequentially through *Cadent → Succedent → Angular*.
The completeness of each stage determines the attainability of the next.

---

## 3.2 Axiom of Directionality

The pathway advances with a **temporal directionality**.
The internal results generated in the cadent phase (understanding, resonance, cooperation) must be translated by the succedent into socially receivable artifacts; otherwise, the angular fixation cannot stabilize.
This directionality does not depend on a fixed duration, but on the **degree of structural closure**.

**Proposition A-2:**
*Cadent → Succedent → Angular* is the only sustainable direction of relational evolution.
If this direction is reversed (for instance, beginning with an angular form and later supplementing the succedent mediation), the fixation stability decreases, producing a **short-shell state**.

---

## 3.3 Axiom of Mediation (Emotional Version)

**Axiom A-3:** *Without succedent mediation, angular fixation cannot be achieved.*

In the emotional domain, *succedent mediation* refers to any artifact that translates emotional connection into a socially recognizable form.
Whether legal contracts, joint assets, children, co-created works, or social recognition—all count as valid mediations.
If a relationship remains within the cadent phase (only emotional and cognitive connection), it lacks a chain of conveyance; thus, even if angular fixation (marriage, family, or social identity) temporarily forms, it cannot last.

---

## 3.4 Axiom of Open Succedents

The succedent houses, as an **open set**, prescribe no single legitimate route.
Different cultures and eras can employ different combinations of mediation, such as:

* Children (5th house);
* Contracts and shared assets (8th house);
* Social or familial recognition (11th house);
* Budget and resource integration (2nd house).

These pathways may operate concurrently or interchangeably; the key lies not in formality but in whether the chain of **output → mediation → fixation** can close.

**Proposition A-4:**
Relational stability does not depend on formal legitimacy but on the **closure degree** of succedent mediation.

---

## 3.5 Axiom of Layer Independence

The strength of the angular houses does not directly determine marital attainability.
If the cadent activation is weak, or if succedent mediation has not formed, then even a strong 7th house or a well-aspected Venus may still yield a state of *“high relational potential but unfixed outcome.”*
In other words, the angular determines **form**, while the succedent determines **sustainability**.

**Proposition A-5:**
Angular strength ≠ marriage attainability.
The potential for marriage depends on **cadent activation** and **succedent mediation**.

---

## 3.6 Axiom of Recurrence

Relational fixation is not an endpoint, but the starting point of a new cycle.
When angular fixation generates a new identity (e.g., “spouse,” “parent”), the individual enters a new cadent cycle of learning and integration—renewed communication, cooperation, and value alignment emerge accordingly.

**Proposition A-6:**
Angular fixation triggers **1′** (a new cadent cycle under a new identity), forming a **spiral of relational evolution**.

---

## 3.7 Theorems T1–T3

* **T1.** The higher the closure degree of the succedent mediation, the more stable the angular fixation.
  (Relational sustainability is positively correlated with the degree of socialization.)

* **T2.** Different “artifact lineages” (child-based, asset-based, community-based, or creation-based) lead to **non-isomorphic forms** of marriage and family.
  (Relational stability does not follow a single model but depends on the composition of succedent structures.)

* **T3.** If broad observation reveals that “stable fixation without succedent mediation” is common, the *Axiom of Mediation* must be revised or its applicability restricted—such as in **pre-installed mediation** cultures (arranged marriage, hereditary families, institutional pairing).

---

### Summary

This chapter establishes the logical foundation of the relational domain.
The sustainability of romance and marriage depends on the **closure degree of the succedent loop**.
The cadents determine **motivation**, the succedents determine **the bridge**, and the angulars determine **fixation**.
Without succedent mediation, the angular form remains merely a **surface phenomenon**.

---

# Chapter 4 · Path Mechanisms: Positive and Negative Loops in Relationships

This chapter develops the structural logic of **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** into a dynamic pathway. The formation and dissolution of romance, marriage, and family can be viewed as cycles repeatedly unfolding in time: once the cadent houses are activated, if succedent mediation closes, the relationship enters positive growth; if succedent mediation breaks, it enters an attenuation loop. This cycling is not merely emotional—it is a form of **structural motion**.

---

## 4.1 The Positive Loop

**Path formula:**

Cadent (communication / daily relating / value alignment) →
Succedent (artifacts / conveyance: 5/8/11/2) →
Angular (fixation: 7 marriage / 4 family / 10 public status) →
**1′** (relation upshift: parenting / family governance / new cycle)

In the positive loop, the cadent houses provide emotional and cognitive drive, the succedent houses undertake artifact-formation and social conveyance, and the angular houses complete structural fixation. The closure of this loop means the relationship moves from **inner attunement** to **external embedding**, gaining a sustainable social form.

**Key features:**

* **Cadent (3/6/9/12):** learning, expression, adaptation, integration → *“We are understanding each other.”*
* **Succedent (2/5/8/11):** artifacts, institutions, bridges, community → *“We created something together.”*
* **Angular (1/4/7/10):** identity, family, contract, social role → *“We are recognized and embedded.”*
* **Stage 1′:** the new relational identity generates a new cadent field (e.g., parenting, joint ventures, long-term communication patterns).

**Proposition L-1:** Relational stability does not arise from angular configurations per se, but from **closure of the succedent loop**.
**Proposition L-2:** In the positive loop, **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** forms the natural rhythm of *move–convey–stabilize*, consistent with energy-conservation logic: if cadent output is absorbed and re-structured by the succedents, the angulars hold firm.

---

## 4.2 The Negative Loop

When the cadents are activated but succedent mediation fails to close, the relationship enters an **attenuation loop**. This explains common phenomena such as “great chemistry but no commitment,” “we get along yet never marry,” or “fated yet unfixed.”

**Path formula:**

Cadent (overload / dysregulation) →
Succedent (free-spinning / under-conveyed) →
Angular (short-shell / pseudo-stability) →
Weak starting point (fragilization in the next cycle)

**Four typical situations:**

| Type                       | Description                                                                                                             | Core defect                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **A. Cadent Overload**     | The bond remains at chatting, resonance, travel, spiritual attunement; high emotional intensity but no artifacts.       | Cadent stalling; energy dissipates.    |
| **B. Succedent Free-Spin** | Artifacts appear but the conveyance chain breaks (e.g., child without contract; cohabitation without shared liability). | Mediation failure; artifacts isolated. |
| **C. Succedent Mismatch**  | Artifact form misfits the stage (e.g., premature publicity without readiness for responsibilities).                     | Sequence error; pathway misalignment.  |
| **D. Angular Short-Shell** | The outer form comes first (e.g., rushed marriage, publicity photos, symbolic pledges).                                 | Shell precedes core; rapid collapse.   |

In these types, the relationship may *appear* “rich” or “advancing” on the surface, but structurally it is succedent failure. Cadent energy has nowhere to settle; the angular form is unstable for lack of mediation and eventually collapses.

**Proposition L-3:** “Not moving forward” is not an emotional problem but a **succedent-chain** problem.
**Proposition L-4:** Under cadent overload, individuals tend to seek more “explanation” and “feeling,” rather than **artifact-formation and conveyance**—a classic **knowledge–action gap**.

---

## 4.3 Three Questions Diagnostic (Relationship Edition)

To determine the current stage and loop type, use the three-question pathway diagnostic:

1. **Cadent:** *What inner results have we formed?*
   (communication rhythm, daily collaboration, value map, trust foundation)
2. **Succedent:** *Into which relational artifacts or conveyance chain have these been translated?*
   (children, contracts, joint assets, co-created works, community, rituals, budget, etc.)
3. **Angular:** *Are our identity or structures stable? Have we entered a sustainable stage (7/4/10)?*

If the answer is **no**, backtrack to Question ② and build the **succedent mediation**.

**Proposition L-5 (Path Judgment):**
If the answer to ② is “none,” the relationship is in a **negative loop**; if the answer is “present and closed,” it is in a **growth loop**.
The three-question system can serve as the **Minimal Diagnostic Unit** for counseling and self-assessment.

---

## 4.4 Conclusion (Summary)

The **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** relationship pathway not only describes developmental stages; it also reveals mechanisms of **energy transformation** and **social conveyance**. If emotion is not translated through the succedents, it remains at the level of feeling and produces **cadent overload**. Only by establishing a stable mediation chain can the relationship **fix** as a real-world structure.

**Compressed summary:**

* **Cadent:** emotion arises;
* **Succedent:** emotion is translated;
* **Angular:** emotion lands.

All relational problems can be traced back to the **succedent**.

# Chapter 5 · House Mapping and Relational Scenarios

This chapter grounds the preceding **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** structure in concrete houses and contexts, establishing a **House Mapping Model** and a **Scenario Matrix** for relationship development. The goal is to render the theory **visualizable, verifiable, and teachable**, so that each house’s psycho-social function has a clear placement within the relational pathway.

---

## 5.1 The Four Cadents: Communication, Adjustment, and Latent Patterns

The cadent houses are the relationship’s **layer of learning and integration**, responsible for promoting mutual cognitive fit. Their energy is not artifact-producing but **feedback-oriented**—within the cadents, both parties “learn as mirrors” of each other.

| House    | Functional Keywords                                 | Relational Layer                                          | Typical Themes                                                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **3rd**  | Communication, expression, information transparency | Linguistic density, message frequency, interaction rhythm | Topic resonance, repair of misunderstandings, drive to express and capacity to listen |
| **6th**  | Service, division of labor, health, habits          | Daily adjustment and life collaboration                   | Housework, responsibility allocation, time management, care of bodily needs           |
| **9th**  | Values, belief, distance and culture                | Worldview integration                                     | Life-goal alignment, cross-cultural relationships, spiritual convictions              |
| **12th** | Unconscious, attachment, healing                    | Hidden dependencies and unconscious compensation          | Projection, avoidance, redemption fantasies, co-dependency patterns                   |

**Proposition H-1:** Matching and unblocking at the cadent layer determines **whether** a relationship can begin; **whether** it can continue depends on whether the **succedents** intervene.

---

## 5.2 The Succedent Spectrum

The succedents are the relationship’s **mediation layer**. At this stage, feelings are translated into socially conveyable **artifacts**—that is, the **visibility** of the relationship. This is the key passage from inner to outer.

| House    | Artifact Type                                                      | Function                                           | Typical Phenomena                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **5th**  | Children, co-creations, memorabilia, pets                          | Joint generative objects; embodied love            | Premarital pregnancy, collaborative art, artistic bonding, commemorative rituals              |
| **8th**  | Joint property, debt, contracts, sexual & psychological commitment | Unity of rights and responsibilities; deep sharing | Cohabitation, mortgage binding, affective fusion, debt sharing                                |
| **11th** | Community, family recognition, social exposure, wedding            | Socialization and visibility of the bond           | Public announcements, appearing together at gatherings, community endorsement, going official |
| **2nd**  | Resources, budgeting, skill assets, quantifiable trust             | Practical and material conveyance                  | Bride price/dowry, budgeted division of labor, joint accounts, complementary skills           |

**Proposition H-2:** If a succedent artifact meets **at least two** of the four criteria—**recognizable, exchangeable, accumulable, scalable**—it has **mediating efficacy**. If none of the four are met, the relationship remains in the **cadent** field and is not yet socialized.

---

## 5.3 The Three Angular Terminals: Fixation and Embedding

The angular houses are the **anchoring layer**. They do not produce affection; they **verify** the solidity of the succedent chain. When an angular window arrives, all artifact-chains are “settled”: with support, fixation occurs; without support, collapse follows.

| House    | Function                                        | Corresponding Events                                                            | Meaning                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **7th**  | Contractual marriage, legal union, partnerships | Marriage registration, going public as partners, signing cooperative agreements | “I enter a contract with the other.”  |
| **4th**  | Home, residence, roots, lineage                 | Cohabitation, purchasing a home, settling, parenting                            | “We establish a common root.”         |
| **10th** | Social identity, titles, public role            | Name change, public notices, professional linkage, formal recognition           | “Society acknowledges our existence.” |

**Proposition H-3:** The angulars function only as a **verification layer**; their **stability = succedent-chain stability × conveyance strength**. **Strong angulars with weak succedents → a shell without stability**; **stable succedents with weak angulars → stability without salience**.

---

## 5.4 Scenario Matrix

The following matrix lists typical relational events and marks their roles within the **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** pathway.

| Scenario                                                    | Activated Houses                                   | Mechanism Type                                                | Outcome                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premarital pregnancy (5th)**                              | Cadent → Succedent → Angular                       | Succedent artifact forms early → triggers 7th or 4th fixation | Rapid fixation; structure not necessarily robust               |
| **Joint home purchase (8th)**                               | Cadent → Succedent → Angular                       | Asset binding strengthens the conveyance chain                | High stability, coupled with long-term obligations             |
| **Community/family recognition (11th)**                     | Cadent → Succedent → Angular                       | External visibility increases → pushes toward legalization    | Stability depends on social pressure and degree of endorsement |
| **Only spiritual resonance (3rd/9th)**                      | Cadent stall                                       | No succedent artifacts → no fixation                          | Cadent overload; energy dissipates                             |
| **Public relationship without conveyance (11th free-spin)** | Cadent → Succedent free-spin → Angular short-shell | Exposure first, no structural support                         | Brief fixation followed by quick relapse                       |
| **Long cohabitation without contracts (8th broken)**        | Cadent → Succedent break → Angular hollow          | No legal/asset backing                                        | Feelings may deepen, but remain unstable                       |
| **Community-built partnership (11th pathway)**              | Cadent → Succedent closure → Angular stability     | Communal institutions replace the marriage contract           | Stable state, but dependent on group energy                    |

**Proposition H-4 (Matrix Principle):** Whether a “fixation” event endures depends on the **type and closure** of mediation, not on emotional intensity. Without succedent support, even if an angular is triggered, it is only **temporary**.

## 5.5 Summary: From Houses to Mechanisms

* The **cadents** supply the **drive of feeling and cognition**;
* The **succedents** supply the **bridge of artifacts and conveyance**;
* The **angulars** supply the **test of form and structure**.

If **cadent** is not followed by **succedent**, **angular** cannot stand.
If **succedent** free-spins, **angular** becomes a short-shell.
If **angular** is strong without **succedent**, the **shell precedes the core**.

**Summary formula:**
**Relational stability = f(succedent closure, angular conveyance)**
**Relational fluidity = f(cadent strength, knowledge–action channels)**

# Chapter 6 · Transits and Temporal Activation in Relationships

This chapter extends the **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** structure into the temporal dimension, establishing the activation logic under **Transits / Progressions / Solar Arc**. In the relational domain, transits do not simply “bring events,” but **phase-light** different functional windows. This mechanism is defined here as **Temporal Activation**.

---

## 6.1 Cadent / Succedent / Angular: Three Temporal Windows

In time, transits can be divided into three functional windows:

| Window (Temporal)    | Corresponding Houses | Activation Task                                             | Temporal Nature                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cadent Window**    | 3 / 6 / 9 / 12       | Communication, adjustment, integration, healing             | Preparation phase, learning phase, cognitive realignment |
| **Succedent Window** | 2 / 5 / 8 / 11       | Artifact-making, relational conveyance, socialization       | Construction phase, bridging phase, realization          |
| **Angular Window**   | 1 / 4 / 7 / 10       | Identity fixation, institutionalization of the relationship | Landing phase, testing phase, embedding phase            |

**Proposition T-1 (Temporal Layer):** Transits **ignite** but do not **land**; landing is determined by the **artifact-making and conveyance chain** of the succedents. Therefore, the significance of transits lies in **stage task cues**, not in fated events.

---

## 6.2 Relational Timing Keys

### (A) Succedent windows have the greatest “fixation potential”

When transits move through the succedents (2/5/8/11), the relational mediation chain most readily forms, is reorganized, or breaks. Events in this period often have **conveyance** or **artifact** qualities, for example:

| Transit House | Typical Events                                              | Functional Note                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **5th**       | Romance, children, co-creative works, emotional coming-out  | Emotional manifestation and **artifactualization** |
| **8th**       | Cohabitation, asset binding, sexual-psychological contracts | Deep integration and **risk sharing**              |
| **11th**      | Community recognition, weddings, public announcements       | **Socialization** and **legalization**             |
| **2nd**       | Budgeting, resource sharing, material planning              | **Practical conveyance**                           |

**Proposition T-2:** The **quality of the succedent window** determines relational sustainability. When a transit activates a succedent, if **at least one** stable mediator (child / asset / contract / recognition) forms, the angular fixation gains **structural support**.

### (B) Angular windows: testing and fixation

When transits enter the angulars (1/4/7/10), the relationship structure enters a **fixation test**. The arrival of an angular does not create affection; it **reveals** whether the succedent chain is stable.

| Transit House | Common Events                                               | Essence                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **7th**       | Registration, engagement, signing, going public as a couple | **Contractual verification**                 |
| **4th**       | Cohabitation, moving, parenting, family decisions           | Landing of roots and responsibilities        |
| **10th**      | Announcements, changes of public status, formal titles      | Social-level recognition and role transition |
| **1st**       | Launch of a new identity, self-recasting                    | The starting point of a new cadent cycle     |

**Proposition T-3:** When transits move through the angulars, if the succedent chain is **not closed**, angular fixation is only a **phenomenal event**; if the chain is **solid**, a **long-range structure** forms.

### (C) Cadent windows: initiation and healing

When transits pass through the cadents (3/6/9/12), the relationship enters a period of **learning and re-organization**. The task at this stage is not “advance,” but **understanding and repair**.

| Transit House | Task                                                 | Typical Manifestations                                                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **3rd**       | Rebuilding communication patterns                    | Frequent exchanges, surfacing of expression blind spots, re-learning to listen |
| **6th**       | Adjusting daily habits                               | Service and caregiving topics, health or work affecting the bond               |
| **9th**       | Updating belief systems                              | Long-distance dynamics, value divergences, reassessing shared aims             |
| **12th**      | Healing old attachments, integrating the unconscious | Letting go, dreams, silence, retreat periods                                   |

**Proposition T-4:** The cadent window is a **meaning-integration window**; if one **forces** movement toward succedent or angular during cadent activation, energy mismatches and relational stress increase.

## 6.3 The Phasic Role of Progressions and Solar Arc

Compared with fast transits, **Secondary Progressions** and **Solar Arc directions** reveal the **deeper tempo**—the decadal-scale **structural turnover** and **role transformation** within relationships. When slow progressions or directed planets enter different house types, the baseline of long-term bonds shifts.

| Type                                            | Indicative Content                                           | Typical Impact                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Progressed / Solar Arc planet enters **cadent** | New understanding, reflection, re-learning communication     | Relationship reboot; post-breakup re-definition          |
| Enters **succedent**                            | Establishing conveyance mechanisms; institutional structures | From romance to cooperation; from ambiguity to contracts |
| Enters **angular**                              | Social results become visible                                | Marriage, childbirth, joint property, public status      |

**Proposition T-5:** In long-term partners, progressed/transiting **Saturn, Pluto, Jupiter** etc. in **succedents** often mark a **conveyance phase**; in **angulars**, a **verification phase**; in **cadents**, an **integration and transition phase**.

---

## 6.4 Temporal Mapping Template

In practice or teaching, the following timeline structure can record and analyze relational stages:

* **T1:** Transit through **cadents** (3/6/9/12) → period of cognitive and communicative adjustment
* **T2:** Transit through **succedents** (2/5/8/11) → period of conveyance and artifacts
* **T3:** Transit through **angulars** (1/4/7/10) → period of fixation and testing
* **T4:** **1′** → re-learning under a new identity (the next cadent starting point)

**Analytic Notes:**

* If **T2** forms **no stable artifacts**, **T3** fixation will show **short-shell characteristics**;
* If **T1** and **T2** connect smoothly, **T3–T4** can enter a **positive loop**;
* Different house combinations produce a unique **relational cadence**, which can be treated as a **Relational Trajectory**.

---

## 6.5 Summary: The Teaching Value of Transits

Transits are not a **trigger of fate**, but a **magnifier of pathways**. They reveal **which task-layer** a relationship needs to complete **now**:

* In **cadents** → **Understand**;
* In **succedents** → **Land**;
* In **angulars** → **Verify**.

**Summary formulas:**
**Temporal Activation = Transit stage × House functional layer**
**Relational Stability = Succedent closure × Angular conveyance**
**Relational Rhythm = Cadent learning → Succedent artifact → Angular fixation → 1′ regenerative cycle**

---

# Chapter 7 · Case Studies: Relational Pathways in Practice

This chapter presents case analyses demonstrating the structural role of the **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** sequence in intimate relationships.
The cases are divided into two types:

1. **Author’s own case** – used as a structural sample.
2. **Typified anonymous cases** – used for comparison and verification of the pathway logic.

This discussion does not make predictions; it observes **house-level** structural closure and temporal activation only.

---

## 7.1 Primary Case (Author’s Own Example)

### (1) Natal Framework (House Level)

**Ascendant Gemini → Relationship Orientation:**
Communicative, mentally fluid, valuing linguistic rhythm and cognitive resonance.
In emotional life, connections often begin with **“expression and understanding.”**

**2nd House cusp in Gemini →** Value systems rely on *expressive production* and *the monetization of knowledge*.
In relationships, material conveyance often manifests through communication, teaching, or joint projects.

**3rd House Cancer holding a Leo stellium (Sun/Mercury/Venus/Jupiter) →**
A strong **cadent concentration**: love and creativity are tightly linked.
Relationships usually begin as **“shared learning and mutual growth.”**

**4th House Leo North Node →**
Goal position: establishing personal roots, family, and spiritual legacy.
Relationships tend toward the creation of a **shared base or spiritual home.**

**7th–8th Houses in Sagittarius →**
Partnerships and deep resources are driven by expansion, cross-cultural exchange, and exploration.
Intimacy often takes the form of **learning, teaching, and traveling together.**

**MC Aquarius (10th House) →**
Socially expressed as a **system-builder and theoretical innovator.**
Love and career are structurally interlocked.

**12th House Aries with Chiron in Taurus →**
Unconscious structure: courageous exploration with underlying vulnerability.
Relationships bring themes of **healing and rebirth.**

**Structural Formula Summary:**
**Cadent (3rd Leo)** → **Succedent (5/8/11)** → **Angular (4th Leo NN / 7th Sagittarius)**
**Relational Theme:** from expression and creation → to conveyance and legacy.

---

### (2) Current Transits and Tertiary Timing

**Progressed Level:**

* **Progressed Pluto, Saturn, Jupiter in 9th (Cadent Window)** → Total reconstruction of worldview and meaning system.
  Emotionally, this signifies a **redefinition of long-term partnership**:
  “A relationship is not emotional resonance but an *ideational community*.”

* **Transiting Saturn and Neptune in 11th Pisces (Succedent Window)** → Emphasis on *community and institutional conveyance*.
  Key focus: *co-building community, collaborative platforms, sustainable rhythm.*

* **Future Angular Goal: 4th House Leo North Node (Angular Window)** →
  Consolidating ideals and communal achievements into **a foundational structure**—potentially realized as a **home base, brand system, or lineage model.**

**Proposition C-1:**
The current temporal pattern is **strong Cadent → necessary Succedent**.
If the 9th-house ideology (Cadent) is materialized through 11th-house social artifacts, the 4th-house angular window will naturally crystallize into a **transmissible root structure.**

---

### (3) Pathway Diagnosis and Evolutionary Stages

| Stage                                | House Layer                     | Current Task                                                               | Risk Point                                     | Recommended Action                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T1 (Cadent Window / 9th)**         | Progressed Pluto/Saturn/Jupiter | Integrate philosophy, redefine meaning of relationship                     | Theoretical overload, practical lag            | Pause relational advancement; model internal beliefs first |
| **T2 (Succedent Window / 11th)**     | Transiting Saturn/Neptune       | Establish conveyance chain (community/institutional/cooperative framework) | Blurred boundaries, energy dispersion          | Materialize succedent products: courses, methods, systems  |
| **T3 (Angular Window / 4th Leo NN)** | Upcoming activation             | Home/foundation/legacy fixation                                            | Insufficient products → structural short-shell | Complete material conveyance before angular activation     |

**Diagnostic Conclusion (Author’s Case):**
Current emotional stability depends on the **quality of succedent conveyance**.
Any new relationship that remains only at **ideational resonance (9th)** without translation into **social cooperation (11th)** will repeat the **“strong Cadent–weak Succedent → short-shell Angular”** pattern.

---

### (4) Structural Recommendations

**Prioritize Succedent Action (11th):**

* Replace emotional flow with **structured output**: build cooperative systems, content architecture, or long-term communities.

**Delay Angular Events (4th):**

* Avoid premature fixation; wait for succedent chain stabilization before moving into **cohabitation / cooperation / domesticization.**

**Maintain Cadent Health (3rd/9th):**

* Balance **expression, learning, and collaboration**; avoid theoretical escapism.

**Protect the Knowledge–Action Channel (3rd–6th):**

* Validate ideals through concrete practice to prevent cadent stagnation and relational compression.

## 7.2 Typified Comparative Cases

| Case Type                                                           | Structural Trait                                        | Cadent–Succedent–Angular Path                   | Outcome                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. 5th-House Type (Child as Mediator)**                           | Cadent → Succedent (5th product) → Angular (7th/4th)    | Succedent closure rapid; angular fixation quick | Stability depends on later maintenance of the product |
| **B. 8th-House Type (Shared Asset as Mediator)**                    | Cadent → Succedent (8th contract) → Angular (4th/10th)  | Strong conveyance chain, shared risk            | High stability but dependent on real-world pressure   |
| **C. 11th-House Type (Community Recognition)**                      | Cadent → Succedent (11th exposure) → Angular (7th/10th) | External validation facilitates legalization    | Stable state but energy easily dissipates             |
| **D. Cadent-Overload Type (Spiritual Resonance without Succedent)** | Cadent → stall → Angular short-shell                    | Lacks mediation chain                           | Surface prosperity with hollow structure              |

---

## 7.3 Case Conclusions

**Conclusion C-2:**
No matter how strong the cadent field is, **without succedent mediation, relationships cannot crystallize into stable structures.**
Fixation is not the *end* of emotion, but the *byproduct* of succedent closure.

**Natal synthesis:**
Your relational drive arises from **learning, communication, and co-creation (Cadent strength)**;
true stability comes from **structured community and institutional cooperation (Succedent path)**;
the final destination lies in building a **transmissible foundation (Angular goal).**

**Simplified Expression:**
**Relationship Pathway = Learning & Creation (Cadent) → Community & Cooperation (Succedent) → Home & Legacy (Angular)**

# Chapter 8 · Falsifiability and Boundaries

This chapter clarifies the scientific and ethical boundaries of the **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** theory in the domain of love and intimate relationships. Any structural theory must be open to questioning and falsification to possess academic validity. Accordingly, this chapter proposes three core propositions (D1–D3) and defines their tests; it also specifies the model’s scope of application across cultural and ethical contexts.

## 8.1 Falsifiable Propositions

**Proposition D1.** The degree of closure in the **Succedent window** corresponds structurally to the stability of **Angular fixation**.
If a relationship exhibits Succedent artifacts (5/8/11/2) and forms a conveyance chain, subsequent Angular events (7 marriage, 4 family, 10 public recognition) show greater durability.
If Succedent artifacts are absent or broken, the stability of Angular events declines markedly.

**Test method:**

* *Sample tracing:* collect ≥ 50 relationship cases; record the interval between their “artifact spectrum” and “Angular events.”

**Statistics:**

* *Closure Index* = number of links closed in the conveyance chain / 4
* *Stability Index* = duration after fixation (months)

If the correlation coefficient between the two remains above **0.6**, the proposition is supported.

---

**Proposition D2.** Different **artifact spectra** → non-isomorphic forms of marriage/family.
Succedent combinations—child-type, asset-type, community-type, work-product-type—lead to **non-isomorphic** marital and family structures (e.g., stability modes, responsibility patterns, psychological needs).

**Test method:**

* Build an “artifact spectrum matrix,” clustering by dominant Succedent.
* Compare structural indicators across clusters: marital duration, remarriage rate, degree of social recognition.

**Expected results:**

* **8th-house type** → stable yet high pressure;
* **5th-house type** → emotionally rich yet energy-consuming;
* **11th-house type** → strong social support yet prone to energy dispersion.

---

**Proposition D3.** If “stable Angular fixation without Succedent mediation” is widely observed, the **Axiom of Mediation** must be revised or its scope restricted.
If repeatable “pre-installed mediation” settings exist (e.g., strong institutional cultures, arranged marriage, civil-service systems), the axiom ceases to be universal and is partially absorbed by cultural variables.

**Test method:**

* In samples with **strong institutional pre-installation**, test Angular stability in the absence of a mediation chain.
* If stability remains high, the **institutional variable** must be incorporated, yielding a **Mediation Preference Factor** within the model.

## 8.2 Research Design and Method Suggestions

| Method Class                | Tool Layer                                                  | Direction of Application                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Longitudinal case narrative | Track the cycle “Cadent → Succedent → Angular → 1′”         | Verify whether stagewise closure recurs                       |
| Typological matrix analysis | Model “artifact spectrum × Angular presentation”            | Compare stability differences across distinct pathways        |
| Boundary-situation study    | Strong institutions, cross-cultural, non-monogamous samples | Test the model’s elasticity and adaptation in plural contexts |

**Proposition D4 (methodological extension).**
The **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** model can be viewed as a systemic function *f(x)* of relational dynamics, where inputs are **time** and **house activation**, and output is **relationship stability**. The differentiability (continuity) of this function stands for the **repairability** of the relationship.

## 8.3 Theoretical Boundaries and Ethical Statement

* **Non-predictive.** The model does not predict wedding dates, breakup timing, or marriage probabilities. It only describes the logical order of structural evolution.
* **Non-prescriptive.** The model does not offer moral judgments or a “correct relationship” prescription. Each cultural system may redefine the legitimacy of the conveyance chain according to its own values.
* **Cultural adaptability.** In highly institutional societies (e.g., Japan, Korea, mainland China), 8th and 10th-house institutional variables weigh more; in individualist societies (e.g., Europe, North America), 5th and 11th-house emotional and communal variables are more salient.
* **Ethical transparency.** Researchers or consultants must explicitly inform participants: this model aims at **structural analysis**, not moral judgment or fatalistic inference.

**Ethical Proposition E-1.**
The validity of **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** lies in helping individuals understand structural pathways, not in reinforcing social norms. Astrology here is treated as a **language of structure**, not a tool of control.

## 8.4 Summary

Falsifiability enables **Modern House Dynamics** to become a genuinely academic theory rather than an esoteric conjecture. In the relational field, **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** logic explains the common phenomenon of “good configuration yet no progression,” and via the **Axiom of Mediation** reveals that the key is not emotional intensity but whether the **conveyance structure** is closed.

**Final summary formulas:**
**Stable relationship** = *f*(Succedent closure × Angular conveyance × cultural variables)
**Growing relationship** = *f*(Cadent activation × knowledge–action channel × Succedent renewal)

# Chapter 9 · Conclusion: From Strength to Path

Traditional astrology explains romantic fate through **“house strength”** or **“configuration quality,”** yet contemporary relationships are no longer defined by a single quadrant. The proposal of **path dynamics**—Cadent–Succedent–Angular—marks a shift from **static strength** to **dynamic pathway**.

## 9.1 From Strength to Path: A Paradigm Shift

In the old paradigm, relationships were **fated** or **bestowed**.
In the new paradigm, relationships are **structurally generated**.

* **Cadent** represents encounter and adjustment—the starting point of meaning and communication.
* **Succedent** is the stage of mediation and artifact formation—translating emotional energy into socially recognizable forms.
* **Angular** is the stage of stabilization and embedding—where relationships gain social recognition and institutionalization.

Under this logic, houses cease to be destiny and become **nodes on a pathway**. Whether a relationship can “come to fruition” depends on **Succedent mediation**, not on whether Angular is “benefic.”

## 9.2 Insights from Path Dynamics

* **Strong Cadent ≠ marriageable.** Many high-cognition resonances (9th) or emotional resonances (12th) remain at the level of “spiritual connection” if they lack Succedent artifacts (5/8/11/2), and thus fail to materialize.
* **Succedent is the social threshold.** It grants private emotion **social exchangeability**, enabling embedding in institutions and structures.
* **Angular is only a mirror.** It adds no new energy; it magnifies the steadiness of the existing chain. Angular “success” is merely the **echo** of a complete Succedent chain.

## 9.3 Theoretical Significance

* **Academic level.** This study offers astrology a falsifiable framework of structural dynamics. It centers not on planetary beneficence/maleficence but on **socially observable structures (artifact chains)** as objects of verification.
* **Psychology and relationship studies.** It provides a new dimension for the sustainability of intimacy: the question shifts from “Does love exist?” to “Is love structurally conveyed?”
* **Practice.** It can be applied directly in consulting and coaching: by identifying the **Cadent–Succedent–Angular** stage, individuals can grasp current tasks, gaps, and loop patterns.

## 9.4 Future Directions

* **Typology.** Build cross-cultural samples and compare Succedent preference sets across societies.
* **Dynamic Relational Mapping.** Data-label transit timelines and artifact spectra to form visual trend models.
* **Interdisciplinary dialogue.** Engage sociology, psychology, and systems theory to explore the **conveyance chain** as a general mechanism of social stability.

## 9.5 Closure

Transits only **ignite**; Succedent **grounds**; the endurance of love relies not on **strong houses** but on a **closed chain**.

**Modern House Dynamics** does not oppose fate; it **redefines** how fate operates:
ignite in **Cadent**, convey in **Succedent**, fix in **Angular**.
Thus love ceases to be a riddle of destiny and becomes the knowledge of **pathways**.

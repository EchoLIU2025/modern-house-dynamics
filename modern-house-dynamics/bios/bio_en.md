**Echo Liu** is a Chinese astrologer and writer based in Japan. Her work focuses on house-level theory and pedagogy, developing tool-agnostic frameworks that bridge classical and psychological astrology. Recent research includes “Modern House Dynamics: Cadent → Succedent → Angular,” which reframes house strength as a pathway of activation, mediation, and consolidation. Working bilingually in English and Chinese, she aims to offer clear, replicable models for teaching and practice across traditions.

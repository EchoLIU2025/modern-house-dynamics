Subject: Query — Modern House Dynamics: Cadent → Succedent → Angular (house-level framework)

Dear TMA Editorial Team,

My name is Echo Liu, a Chinese astrologer and writer based in Japan. I’d like to query an article proposal titled:

“Modern House Dynamics: From Strength to Pathways (Cadent → Succedent → Angular)”

Abstract (≈180–200 words)
This piece re-examines the classical ranking of houses (angular > succedent > cadent) and reframes it as a dynamic pathway: cadent powers the path, succedent mediates, angular consolidates. Rather than treating houses as a static hierarchy of “strength,” the model articulates their sequential roles in contemporary life. Cadent houses generate learning, practice, worldview, and integration; succedent houses translate these inner outputs into socially up-taken artifacts/resources/relations (defined as an open set, media-neutral); angular houses consolidate them into identity and structure. The framework is strictly house-level, tool-agnostic, and non-predictive—it does not rely on dignities, aspects, or case prescriptions. The aim is to offer a shared backbone across traditions (classical to psychological) and to improve explanatory clarity in teaching and practice by shifting the question from “where is strong” to “how results are reached and stabilized.”

Specs
